## 🔧 How It Works

### AI Training:

The AI is now prompted with:

```typescript
System: "You are a cosmic onchain oracle who speaks in Jesse Pollak's tone: 
minimal, declarative, builder-focused. Every horoscope feels like advice 
for crypto builders. Visionary but ironic."

Examples:
- "You've been delaying your deploy. Push today."
- "The onchain economy doesn't care about your sign. Only your history."
- "That's not luck. That's conviction. Ship the next thing."
```

### Gas Energy Calculation:

```typescript
activityRate = lifetimeTxCount / accountAge

if (activityRate > 5 || degenScore >= 80) → HIGH GAS
if (activityRate > 1 || degenScore >= 40) → MEDIUM GAS
else → LOW GAS
```

### Builder Compatibility:

- Active signs pair with analytical signs
