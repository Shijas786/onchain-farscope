# Onchain Horoscope Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Reown AppKit for wallet connection
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for horoscope generation
- Covalent API for multi-chain blockchain data
- Axios for HTTP requests

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use 'use client' directive for client components
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper error handling with try-catch

## File Structure
- `/app` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `/components` - React components (ui/ for shadcn components)
- `/lib` - Utility functions, API clients, configurations

## Multi-Chain Support
- Primary: Covalent API (Ethereum + Base + more)
- Fallback: BaseScan API (Base only)
- Always handle chain data as an array
- Include chain metadata in responses

## Environment Variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY - Required for GPT
- NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID - Required for wallet
- COVALENT_API_KEY - Recommended for multi-chain
- BASESCAN_API_KEY - Fallback for Base only

## Best Practices
- Always validate wallet addresses
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Show loading states for async operations
- Use motion components for animations
- Keep horoscopes under 200 words
- Cache wallet data when possible
- Log errors for debugging

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Dark theme with cosmic gradients
- Purple/pink color scheme
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear error messages for users
- Loading states with cosmic animations
